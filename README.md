# Analysis and Simulation of Multi-agents System Formation Control.

## Abstract 
This project is focused on the analysis of automatic control laws that allow a multi-agents system of robots to reach desired formations in the 3D space. 
Fist we perform a study on the state-of-art techniques for multi-agents control, then we develope a graphical software application to simulate such methods and compare them to establish benefits and drawbacks of each one.
